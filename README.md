##travelogger

Travelogger is a full-stack web application to track a userâ€™s travel adventures. It provides a lightweight day-by-day snapshot of your trip, including who, what, where, and how each day went.

Building on the first version of Travelogger, this version makes extensive use of Material Design as implemented in the angular-material framework.
